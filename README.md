# PCB-tiny-defects-detections
 The goal of this project is to accurately identify and classify different types of defects on PCBs, such as spurious copper, mouse bite, open circuit, missing hole, spur, and short.  the process of detecting defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) using the YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 object detection model.
